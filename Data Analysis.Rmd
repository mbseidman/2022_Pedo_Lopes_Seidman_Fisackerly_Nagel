Let's start by loading in the data

```{r}

demographics <- read.csv(here("Data","0_Demographics.csv"))

coding <- read.csv(here("Data","1_Combined_Coding.csv"), skip = 5)

# Indicate factors

coding$Category.coding.step.1

coding$Category.coding.step.1 <- as_factor(coding$Category.coding.step.1)

# Let's remove the excess columns that we don't need

# coding <- 

merged <- left_join(demographics, coding, by = "Name")

# Remove Gray, Reshanda, Gustafson, Megan, Holmes, Joyner, Perry, Chelsey, 
# Samuelson, Karlie, Walker-Kimbrough, Shatori,

merged <- merged %>%
  filter(Use == 0)

# Let's start with Frequency of codes
